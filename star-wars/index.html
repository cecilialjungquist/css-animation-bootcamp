            <h1>A NEW HOPE</h1>
            <p>It is a period of civil wars in the galaxy. A brave alliance of underground freedom fighters has challenged
                the tyranny and oppression of the awesome GALACTIC EMPIRE.
                <br><br>
                Striking from a fortress hidden among the billion stars of the galaxy, rebel spaceships have won their first
                victory in a battle with the powerful Imperial Starfleet. The EMPIRE fears that another defeat could bring a
                thousand more solar systems into the rebellion, and Imperial control over the galaxy would be lost forever.
                <br><br>
                To crush the rebellion once and for all, the EMPIRE is constructing a sinister new battle station. Powerful
                enough to destroy an entire planet, its completion spells certain doom for the champions of freedom.
